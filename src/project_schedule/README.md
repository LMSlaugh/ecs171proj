# Gantt Chart

Update `progress.txt` as needed, then run

```
python gantt.py
```

It will give you a KeyError, but don't worry.

Tasks:
1. Gather data into .csv (with headers) and save to Github so we all are usingthe same set
2. Create a data_parser.py that will parse the data and put it into the correct arrays
3. Feature Elimination
    * Must at least mention this in the paper - “We chose these because”, or someone could do a more robust evaluation
4. Perform outlier detection
5. Normalize data
6. Re-perform Logistic Regression with cleaned up data
7. Perform K-means clustering
8. Perform classification using artificial neural network
9. Finalize paper (We should all be adding to the paper as we perform our work - even just bullet points. This will make things go really easy at the end)
10. Create Powerpoint presentation (Pull from the paper, make sure everyone has a place to talk)
